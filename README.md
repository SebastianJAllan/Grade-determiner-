### This project applies the contributions of team members to the final score of a group's project
### It is scaled from 1 to 5
### 1= no contribution
### 2= little to small contribution
### 3= standard level of contribution
### 4= Above average in contribution
### 5= Exceeded all expectations with contribution

### Each team member was marked on 5 attributes from the mention scale, and then the average of those scores is given to the team member
### Depending on the number, it will either decrease or amplify the final grade of the team member
